# Style Guide for Springer Nature Journals

## Journal Authors

We recommend that you use the Springer Nature LaTeX authoring template, which you can [download as a .zip](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/18782940/data/v7) or [access via Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-nature-latex-template/gsvvftmrppwq). This template takes a ‘content first’ approach with minimal formatting. Instead it is designed to promote editorial policy best practice, and move seamlessly through editorial and production systems.

### Preparing your research
We understand that many researchers prefer to use LaTeX when preparing a manuscript for submission, but that it can sometimes be difficult to navigate. That’s why we’re providing this comprehensive set of LaTeX resources to help simplify the process. 

To help avoid any errors: 

- Please do not use any custom fonts

- Make sure you convert special characters, including diacritics such as ä/ö/ü, into the appropriate TeX code, like \"a, \"o, \"u

### Submitting your research
We know from feedback that uploading source files for submission can be time consuming and, if those files fail to convert, the reasons are not always easy to identify.

To help with your submission:

- Please check for errors in your local compilation before uploading your files to the submission system

- Please fix any errors before you try to submit your paper, otherwise it will most likely fail to compile

If you are submitting to Editorial Manager and your source files fail to convert, you will be provided with an error log file to help you identify the source of the error, for example: ! LaTeX Error: File ‘trackchanges.sty’ not found. If you are submitting to eJP using the Springer Nature LaTeX template you will need to use the pdflatex option in the preamble to allow PDF compilation.
